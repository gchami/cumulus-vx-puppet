## Usage

### In your own network

Install these modules on your Puppet server.

### Within the Cumulus Workbench

In the [workbench](http://cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus-workbench/) you can install the package cldemo-wbench-ospfunnum-puppet. When this package is installed a [postinst](https://github.com/CumulusNetworks/cldemo/blob/master/pkgs/workbench/cldemo-wbench-ospfunnum-puppet/debian/DEBIAN/postinst) contained in the package performs these actions:

* Clones this git repo into /home/cumulus/example-ospfunnum-puppet
* Install any dependencies using [librarian-puppet](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) (from metadata.json)
* Symlinks the Puppetmaster directories (files, manifests, modules and templates) into /etc/puppet/
* Looks at the topology of the workbench and symlinks the correct site.pp file
