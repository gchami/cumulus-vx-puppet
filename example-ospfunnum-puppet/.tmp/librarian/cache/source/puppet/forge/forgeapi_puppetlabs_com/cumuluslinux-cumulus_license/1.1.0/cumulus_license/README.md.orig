## Overview

This module installs a Cumulus Linux license.

## Module Description

Installs a Cumulus Linux license file on a Cumulus Linux switch.

<<<<<<< HEAD
If a license is already installed, the module will not attempt to overwrite the existing license. You can overwrite the license with the `force` parameter.

For more details, read the [Cumulus Linux User Guide](http://docs.cumulusnetworks.com) and search for "License".

## Setup

### What cumulus_license affects

This module uses the Cumulus Linux `cl-license` command to manage the license.

When installing a new license, `switchd` must be restarted using ``service switchd restart``.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**NOTE**: 
Restarting the `switchd` daemon is disruptive.

## Usage

	  notify => Service['switchd'] 
	}
}
```

Checking when the license expires will be available in a later release.

`puppet resource cumulus_license` doesn't work. This feature will be implemented in a later version.
